# R Bridge Week 1 Assignment

# 1. Write a loop that calculates 12-factorial

```{r}
factorial = 1
for (n in 1:12){ 
  if(n == 1) factorial= 1
  else {
    factorial <- factorial * n
  }
  cat(n, "!:", factorial, "\n")
}
```


# 2. Show how to create a numeric vector that contains the sequence from 20 to 50 by 5. 


```{r}
vector <- c(seq.int(20, 50, by = 5))
vector

```



# 3. Create the function “quadratic” that takes a trio of input numbers a, b, and c and solve the quadratic equation. The function should print as output the two solutions.

```{r}
 quadratic <- function(a, b, c) {
  Sqrtnum <- b^2 - 4*a*c
  if(Sqrtnum > 0) {
    x1 <- (-b+sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
    x2 <- (-b-sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
    x3 <- c(x1, x2)
    x3
  } else if (Sqrtnum == 0) {
    x3 <- -b/(2*a)
    x3
  } else {"the number under square root is zero or less."}
}

quadratic(5, -3, -2)

quadratic(6, 9, 4)
```
